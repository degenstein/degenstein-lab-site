      <p class="text-sm sm:text-base leading-relaxed opacity-90">
        XRP is built for speed and finality in the world of money plumbing.
        Instead of being “just another coin,” its core pitch is simple:
        become a neutral bridge asset for banks, fintechs, and payment
        providers moving value across borders in seconds instead of days.
      </p>
      <p class="text-sm sm:text-base leading-relaxed opacity-90 mt-4">
        The bigger the global settlement and remittance markets become
        — and the more pressure there is to move away from slow,
        expensive legacy systems — the more interesting XRP’s role
        as a liquidity bridge and settlement asset can be.

        <li><span class="font-medium">Regulatory clarity:</span> ongoing legal clarity for XRP in major markets
            can open the door for more structured financial products and deeper institutional comfort.</li>
        <li><span class="font-medium">Payment partnerships:</span> real world usage via banks, remittance firms,
            and fintechs actually routing value through XRP rails, not just testing in the background.</li>
        <li><span class="font-medium">ETFs & structured products:</span> interest in XRP-linked strategies
            (covered calls, baskets, yield overlays, etc.) is a signal of growing institutional appetite.</li>
        <li><span class="font-medium">Liquidity depth:</span> tighter spreads and deeper books across
            major exchanges and jurisdictions make XRP more attractive as a settlement asset.</li>
        <li><span class="font-medium">Macro backdrop:</span> if liquidity returns to crypto broadly and
            real-utility narratives dominate, XRP is well positioned as a “pipes and rails” asset.</li>

    <!-- 3. Where I See Potential Value -->

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">Where I See Potential Value</h2>
      <p class="text-sm sm:text-base leading-relaxed opacity-90">
        XRP is not a meme coin bet. It’s a thesis on financial infrastructure:
        if cross-border payments modernize, there needs to be high-speed,
        high-liquidity assets and networks underneath. XRP’s edge is speed,
        low cost, and years of battle-tested uptime.
      </p>
      <p class="text-sm sm:text-base leading-relaxed opacity-90 mt-4">
        The upside case comes from <span class="font-medium">real settlement volume</span> flowing through
        XRP-enabled rails, combined with structural demand from institutions,
        payment providers, and potentially ETF-style products that need exposure.
        The risk side is straightforward: if adoption stalls, regulation chokes it
        in key regions, or other rails win the narrative, that upside is capped.

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">How I Play XRP: Earn While I Hold</h2>
      <p class="text-sm sm:text-base leading-relaxed opacity-90">
        My personal angle with XRP is simple: I treat it as a long-term infrastructure bet,
        so I prefer to <strong>earn yield while I wait</strong> instead of just letting it sit idle.
      </p>
      <p class="text-sm sm:text-base leading-relaxed opacity-90 mt-3">
        Rather than trying to out-trade every pump and dump, I look for ways to:
      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-sm sm:text-base leading-relaxed space-y-1 mt-2 opacity-90">
        <li>Hold core XRP exposure for the 2026+ catalyst window.</li>
        <li>Pair it with yield strategies so time works in my favor.</li>
        <li>Focus on <strong>risk-managed, passive income</strong> instead of constant leverage.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="text-sm sm:text-base leading-relaxed opacity-90 mt-4">
        One of the platforms I personally use is <strong>CoinDepo</strong>, where it’s possible to earn
        up to <strong>24% APR</strong> on supported assets while holding — no trading, no selling,
        just compounding over time. Terms always apply, and this is not advice; it’s simply how
        I structure part of my own strategy.

    <!-- 5. Closing Thoughts -->
    <div class="mt-10">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">Final Thoughts</h2>
      <p class="text-sm sm:text-base leading-relaxed opacity-90">
        XRP is one of the few large-cap assets where the thesis is less about memes
        and more about <strong>infrastructure, rails, and settlement</strong>. That doesn’t guarantee
        success, but it does give it a clear role in a more mature crypto cycle where
        real-world usage and institutional adoption start to matter more.
      </p>
      <p class="text-sm sm:text-base leading-relaxed opacity-90 mt-4">
        My approach is straightforward: accumulate what I’m comfortable with,
        let time and catalysts play out, and use yield strategies so my bags
        are working for me instead of just sitting on an exchange.
