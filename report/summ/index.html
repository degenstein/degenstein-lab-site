  <h1>Summ — Crypto Tax Infrastructure (2026 Outlook)</h1>

  <p><strong>Category:</strong> Infrastructure / Compliance Tools</p>

  <hr>

  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>
    Summ is a crypto tax preparation platform designed to track, normalize,
    and reconcile on-chain and exchange activity into tax-ready reports.
  </p>

  <p>
    This is not a speculative product. It is infrastructure built for active
    crypto users operating across multiple wallets, chains, and protocols.
  </p>

  <h2>What Summ Does</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Aggregates activity across centralized exchanges</li>
    <li>Tracks multiple wallets and blockchains</li>
    <li>Normalizes DeFi transactions into tax-readable events</li>
    <li>Generates reports for compliant tax filing</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Summ is built for real crypto behavior — not just buy-and-hold accounts.
  </p>

  <h2>Why Crypto Tax Software Is Now Mandatory</h2>
  <p>
    As crypto adoption grows, reporting requirements increase. On-chain
    activity is increasingly traceable, and manual tracking does not scale.
  </p>

  <p>
    Crypto tax software is no longer optional friction. It is a structural
    requirement for active participants.
  </p>

  <hr>

  <h2>Demand Drivers</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>More on-chain activity per user</li>
    <li>More wallets and cross-chain movement</li>
    <li>Increased regulatory clarity and enforcement</li>
    <li>Higher cost of reporting errors</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    This creates forced demand for accurate, automated tax infrastructure.
  </p>

  <h2>How Summ Fits</h2>
  <p>
    Summ competes on coverage breadth, accuracy, and time saved.
    Its primary value is reducing human error — the largest hidden risk
    in crypto tax reporting.
  </p>

  <hr>

  <h2>Risks & Limitations</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Tax rules change over time</li>
    <li>Complex DeFi activity may still require review</li>
    <li>Software does not replace professional tax advice</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Summ reduces complexity but does not eliminate responsibility.
  </p>

  <h2>Cost vs Value</h2>
  <p>
    The real comparison is not Summ versus free tools.
    It is Summ versus time lost, error risk, and audit exposure.
  </p>

  <p>
    For active crypto users, the value is primarily time efficiency
    and risk reduction.

  <h2>Final Take</h2>
  <p>
    Crypto taxes are structural overhead in a maturing ecosystem.
    Summ operates as compliance infrastructure — not a hype product,
    but a necessary one.
  </p>

  <p>
    This is what real adoption looks like.
